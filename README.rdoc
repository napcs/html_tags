= html_tags

Makes Rails helpers generate tags in HTML syntax 
instead of the XHTML 1.0 syntax it uses. 

 * <tt>input</tt> no longer self-closes
 * <tt>img</tt> no longer self-closes
 * <tt>link</tt> no longer self-closes

== Issues

I haven't created tests for every possible tag case yet, but we have a start.

I'm also a little unconfortable with the way this hacks the internals of Rails. I'll keep looking for better ways.
